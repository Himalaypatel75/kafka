# Kafka Setup and Usage Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and using Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform. Apache Kafka uses Zookeeper for distributed coordination and provides a reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant messaging system.

### System Configuration
Make sure to configure the following settings in your environment:

- Zookeeper: `localhost:2181`
- Kafka: `localhost:9092`


## Run Zookeeper
Start the Zookeeper server by executing the following command:

```bash
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

## Run Kafka Server
Launch the Kafka server with the following command:

```bash
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

## Create Kafka Topic
Create a Kafka topic named "cities" using the following command:

```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic cities
```

## Topic Details
Retrieve details about the "cities" Kafka topic with the following command:

```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic cities
```

## Send Message to Kafka Topic
Send a message to the "cities" Kafka topic using the producer:

```bash
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic cities
```

## Consume Messages
Consume messages from the "cities" Kafka topic using the consumer:

```bash
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic cities
```

## Consume Messages from Beginning
Consume messages from the beginning of the "cities" Kafka topic with the following command:

```bash
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic cities --from-beginning
```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to configure your system with the specified Zookeeper and Kafka addresses.
- Customize Docker options as needed for your environment.
- Explore advanced Kafka configurations in the respective configuration files.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on setting up Kafka! ðŸŽ‰
Now you're ready to leverage the power of distributed streaming for your applications. If you have any questions or run into issues, refer to the [official Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) for more details. Happy streaming! ðŸš€
